This article covers how to deploy a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
instance of a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application to 
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). We are going to set up an [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) 
server to proxy requests and provide support for HTTPS.

AWS provides a generous free tier service that should cover the costs for all
the steps described in this post. The sign up process is very simple, you should
be ready in no time.

## Setting up an EC2 instance

Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign in
using your account credentials. Click on the `EC2` service.

From the EC2 Dashboard, select Instances, then find the `Launch Instances`
button:

alt='Launch EC2 Instance button' %}

We are going to select `Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type` as the 
template for our instance. It is eligible for the free tier.

alt='Select Amazon Linux 2 AMI' %}

On step 2, we will choose `t2.micro` as the Instance Type. It is small and not
very powerful but will be enough for this exercise. It is also eligible for the
free tier.

We are going to use default settings on some of these steps. If you are not in 
a hurry, take some time to read what the defaults are and get familiar with 
the interface.

Step 3 is Configure Instance Details. Let's accept defaults in this step.

{% asset configure-instance.png class='img-fluid mx-auto' alt='Accept defaults' %}

Next step is Add Storage. Accept defaults as well.

Step 5: Add Tags, we will add a tag to identify our application. Use `name` for
the key and `rails-app` for the value. Click on Next: Configure Security Group.

Step 6: Configure Security Group, we will expose ports 80 and 443 for HTTP and
HTTPS traffic from anywhere in the internet. We will also need the SSH port
open. I like to limit the SSH access to my IP only, but you can decide different
as long as you understand the risks.

alt='Configure Security Group' %}

The last Step will be a Review, if everything looks good click on the `Launch`
button. You will be prompted for a key pair to allow you to connect to this
instance. You can select an existing one or generate a new one. If this is your
first time here, your only option is to create one.

Download your newly generated key-pair and store it in a secure place. These are
the keys to your instance and you won't be able to download this again.

{% asset key-pair.png class='img-fluid mx-auto' alt='Key Pair' %}

Click on the `Launch Instances` button. Voila! You have successfully setup
your instance and your are now looking at the Launch Status page, click on the
`View Instances` when you are done reading here.

## Connect to the Instance
